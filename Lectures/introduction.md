SWC Bootcamp Introduction
=========================

Hi, I'm Ethan White.

I'm a faculty member in the Biology Department at Utah State University.
I study global scale patterns in ecological systems related to things like
biodiversity.

And I'm a Software Carpentry student myself. 

I started doing Software Carpentry three years ago when my daughter was born.
For the first few months it was pretty hard to get any focused work done
but there were lots of little bits of time just sitting around waiting so I
started to work my way through the previous version of the material reading
the web pages on my phone.
Now 3 years later my lab uses every tool we're going to show you on a nearly
daily basis.
This has led to us doing research faster and with fewer errors.
So, as a fellow scientists I can tell that this stuff is definitely worth
learning and that even though it will often be difficult at first it is
definitely possible to learn it, even as a sleep deprived father of a newborn.

Psychology

Programming is for humans

The first thing you need to understand is the magic number 7 +- 2
Two kinds of memory:

### Memory

1. Long-term memory, unlimited capacity, really slow
2. Short-term, really fast
  * Phone numbers 6-8 digits
  * Modern phone numbers are big (area code + 7)
  * but we don't remember area codes as 3 digits, we remember them as 1 chunk

### Chunking

* Numbers on dice
* Chess masters

So what does this mean for writing code.
If at any point in a program your brain has to remember more than about 7 facts
then you won't be able write or understand the next line of code very well
If there are 30 variables floating around that we have to keep track of our
error rates are going to sky rocket.
What we have to do when we're building software is cut things down, squeeze
them down into chunks that fit into working memory
This is key to building larger programs that actually work
If we do this chunking well, the chunks can be reused,
but the real reason is we have to fit things into short-term memory.
Make sure that you have the right set of chunks, which only comes with practice

1. Red light - Green light
2. Etherpad
3. Peer instruction
4. Feedback - minute cards

Remember
--------

1. Strongly encourage interaction
2. Minute cards at breaks
3. Don't lecture too much
4. Put problems up on screen
